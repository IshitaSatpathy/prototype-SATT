SATT - Startup Acceleration Think Tank

## PR info 
We will be using a template for building this website the template download link will be given and parts will be assigned to members .
They are assigned to use the template to build their section and then add in the main website and then give a PR.

## Adding CSS 
1. Make Separate CSS files for each section
2. DO NOT add css to the main CSS file . 
3. Name the class of the parent container of your section as container-<section_name>.
4. Name the classes with names that would not collide with any other sections class names.
5. Avoid using .containers, .aside, as your class names and use .container-gallery, .aside-gallery as class names.
6. dont use tag specific selection like p , a , li , etc give them a class and then use that to add CSS.
